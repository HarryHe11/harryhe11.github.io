### **Data Science Competitions**

+ **Alibaba Cloud Tianchi Big Data Competition: The Purchase and Redemption Forecasts** [[code]](https://github.com/HarryHe11/Tianchi-PRF)
<br>Implemented an XGBoost regression model to predict future cash flows (i.e., purchase and redemption) of Ant Financial Services Group. Utilized 46 features based on historical trading records and achieved a final online score of 132.89, placing in the top 5% worldwide.

+ **Bank of Jiangsu Financial Big Data Modeling Challenge 2020: Loan Risk Prediction Based on Machine Learning** 
<br>Developed an XGBoost classification model to detect customers likely to default on their loans within the forthcoming six months. Utilized 51 features based on customer information, loan characteristics, and in-loan behaviors, achieving remarkable results with an F1 score of 73%.

<br>An easy-to-use and pretty code template for training and evaluating text classification models based on PyTorch.

+ **AI for Social Good!**
<br>Applying AI for social good and improving our community has become one of my life goals. Working closely with [Prof. Yupeng Li](http://jour.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/dr-li-yupeng/) at HKBU, I have participated in various research projects using AI techniques to analyze social problems, including:
<br>1. Does the Divergence of Vaccine Stance Induce Incivility? A Social Network Analysis of Conversation Threads on Online Forums (Orally presented on ICA 2023)
<br>2. Data Analyses of Public Stance towards COVID-19 Vaccination [[research report]](https://research.hkbu.edu.hk/f/page/20480/21996/(EN)OVH_Report_No.14_V2.pdf)
<br>3. Using Machine Learning to Analyze Residents’ Anxiety amid the COVID-19 [[research report]](https://research.hkbu.edu.hk/f/page/20923/23009/Anxiety_Report_Eng_Final.pdf)

+ **Football**
 <br>As one of the most loyal fans of the German football club Borussia Dortmund and its captain Marco Reus. At the same time, I deeply appreciate the talents of Erling Haaland and C.Ronaldo.
