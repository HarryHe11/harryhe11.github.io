### **Data Science Competitions**

+ **Aliyun Tianchi Big Data Competition: Purchase and Redemption Forecast Challenge** [[code]](https://github.com/HarryHe11/Tianchi-PRF)
<br>Forecasted Alipay's daily capital inflow and outflow (i.e., purchase and redemption amounts) in the forthcoming month by designing an XGBoost regression model, which used 46 features based on historical trading records and achieved a final online score of 132.89, ranking Top 5% worldwide.

+ **Bank of Jiangsu Financial Big data Modeling Challenge 2020: Loan Risk Prediction Based on Machine Learning** 
<br>Predicted customers who would have bad debts in the forthcoming six months by designing an XGBoost model, which used 51 features based on the in-loan behaviours of the customers and achieved an F1 score of 73%, ranking the Top 10%.

### **Miscellaneous**
+ **Pretty Text Classification: A 100+ Stars Github Repo** [[link]](https://github.com/HarryHe11/Pretty-Pytorch-Text-Classification)
<br>In this project, I provided the NLP community with an easy-to-use and pretty training and evaluating code template for text classification models based on Pytorch.

+ **Technology for Social Good!**
<br>Applying AI and other technology for social good and improve our community have become one of my life goals. I would be happy to volunteer in **non-profit** projects for improving our society. Feel free to drop me an [email](hehaorui11@gmail.com)!
<br>Working closely with [Prof. Yupeng Li](http://jour.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/dr-li-yupeng/) at Hong Kong Baptist University, I participated in various projects aiming to combat COVID-19.
<br>1. Data Analyses of Public Stance towards COVID-19 Vaccination [[research report]](https://research.hkbu.edu.hk/f/page/20480/21996/(EN)OVH_Report_No.14_V2.pdf)
<br>2. Using Machine Learning to Analyze Residents’ Anxiety amid the COVID-19 [[research report]](https://research.hkbu.edu.hk/f/page/20923/23009/Anxiety_Report_Eng_Final.pdf)
<br>3. Visualization for Spatial-Temporal Dynamics for the Fifth Wave of COVID-19 in Hong Kong [[website]](coronavirus-dynamics-hk.github.io)

+ **Football**
 <br>I am one of the most loyal fans of the German football club Borussia Dortmund and its captain Marco Reus. At the same time, I appreciate Erling Haaland and Cristiano Ronaldo very much.
